Below are some of the insights about my Dashboard:
1.	At the top with the year picker and followed by the
•	Total Head Count in an Organisation.
•	Active Employees.
•	New Joiners’ of the year.
•	Terminations happened in the specific year.
•	Average age of Employees present in an Organisation.
2.	Demographic Details which represents the number of Male and Female employees in an organisation in (%).  Having said that, Female count is noticeably more than Male.
3.	Production Technician I top’s the Total Head Count by position wise followed by Production Technician II, Area Sales Manager etc.
4.	No. of Employees working under the same manager which gives quick insight of Tam Handling to the HR.
5.	It was seen that ‘50000 - 100000’ accounts for the majority of Salary range in an organisation (84%) followed by ‘0 – 50000’ which is around 8% and above ‘100000’ which is around 7%.
6.	Total Head count by Performance score is yet another important insight which give details about how many of them fully meets, exceeds, need improvement or in PIP.  From the Dashboard ‘162’ of them are fully meets, whereas ‘29’ of them exceeds their performance, ‘8’ of them needs improvement and other ‘8’ of them are in PIP to improve their performance.
7.	Employee Satisfaction by Average which represents the average score where employee satisfied by the company.  A target has been set to at least it should reach ‘4.5’ out of ‘5’ which is maximum and ‘0’ is the minimum.  So, from the dashboard it clearly says that ‘3.9’ is the average employee satisfaction survey in a particular year given by the employees.
8.	Each year some people attain their age which is above the retirement age so that they had to retire from the company as per the company norms which is one of the important insights for the HR.  Nearing to the retirement age visualizes ‘5’ of them are eligible to retire, ‘11’ of them are nearing to the retirement age and ‘191’ of them are the far against to the retirement age in a particular year.
9.	Top reasons for terminations show that the reason why the employee has left the organisation.  That reason could anything like unhappy with the organisation or they could have secured another job which is better than the current one or the company itself maybe have terminated their employee citing low performance or cost cutting etc.  From the visualisation it is clearly shows that ’14’ has left the company in a particular year because they were unhappy, ‘11’ of them has more money to survive for the rest of their lives, ‘5’ of them have relocate to other areas.

By concluding it, this is it about my HR analytics dashboard with some insight that got while transforming the Dataset.
